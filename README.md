# Otoplayer

This is a music player I originally codesigned with Gregory Pignot in 2008 for the website ototo√Ømusic.

The album included in this repo is on the excellent music label Staubgold, if you like it you can buy it on <a href="https://staubgold.bandcamp.com/album/la-double-absence">bandcamp</a>.

More examples are available on <a href="https://www.ototoi.fr/otoplayer">otoplayer demo webpage</a>.
